I obtained my baccalaureate diploma in natural science in 2016 and a B.A. in Electronicand informatics in 2019. I have recently taken a decision to pursue my studies in the area of Electronic- Microelectronics engineering. My greatest strength is my ability to work well in a team environment. I really love working as part of a wider multi-cultural team. I am someone who sees into the big picture : I dream of initiating my own project/product from the scratch until it becomes something common not only in my country but in the entire world. I am an innovative and creative person. I have many projects ideas to do for this year and I am doing my best and trying to snatch every single opportunity to take part in renowned international challenges‚Ä¶ I am interested in Embedded Systems and Web developement and I would like to become a certified expert in this area.",
